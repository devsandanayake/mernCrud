# mernCrud
Welcome to my GitHub repository for MERN CRUD! In this project, I explore the basics of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data using the MERN stack. You'll find all the necessary code and instructions to get you up and running with creating your own CRUD application with MERN in no time. Have fun exploring, learning, and building!
